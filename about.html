                    <p class="col-5">An open collective is a voluntary and dynamic group of people sharing common goals and values, combining the scale and instantaneous connectivity of online networks with the kinship created in physical space through face-to-face interaction. As permeable hybrid physical/digital networks, open collectives are designed to expand and contract in both members and functions — economic, environmental, and/or social — and encourage new forms of sharing.</p>

                    <h3 class="h2 red mb-2">Why do open collectives matter?</h3>
                    <p>In the last few years, this groundswell of new collectives began as a response to growing inequality. As the coronavirus pandemic swept the world, exposing the brittleness of our economies and feebleness of the state, collectives rapidly became essential. Open collectives provide mutual aid — whether housing, care, labor, or fiscal liquidity — rather than the all-consuming communal approaches of their predecessors. What distinguishes them from the exploitative “gig economy” is an interrogation of who makes decisions; who receives access, safety, and care; and how wealth, power, and knowledge are shared.</p>
                    <p>Many of these collectives begin as either analog- or online-only networks that eventually seek (and struggle) to leverage the power of the other. Where are opportunities to combine architecture, urbanism, and the digital to reinforce and empower today’s open collectives? How do these new typologies, forms, and algorithms in turn shift existing order and further equity? What’s at stake today is a radical reconsideration of how we will live together in the devastating wake of a global pandemic and sharpened economic precarity.</p>

                    <p>Along with historical precedents, the following case studies informed our work.</p>
                    <p><b class="red">Quipu</b> is a micro-currency platform and physical marketplace empowering members of a low-income community in Colombia, 75% of whom are resettled victims of armed conflict.</p>
                    <p><b class="red">Mosaic.us</b> is a full-stack construction technology company that develops technologies to make construction more efficient, build places people love, and make them widely available.</p>
                    <p><b class="red">Carehaus</b> is the United States’ first intergenerational care-based co-living project for older and disabled adults, caregivers, and their families. Re-appropriating the concept of the Israeli kibbutz to meet 21st century urban trends.</p>
                    <p><b class="red">Communit</b> offers low-cost collective living in abandoned buildings in a neighborhood known for its worker history and mixed, diverse population. Each of these projects asks how communities can be organized and strengthened through combining the digital and the urban — by repurposing computational tools to restructure financial equity, knowledge-sharing, health and well-being, and designing architectural forms attentive to the power of physical presence through digital touchpoints.</p>
